# Introduction
This project is created as part of the course 'Heuristieken' at the University of Amsterdam. 
Amstelhaege is a new building project just south of Amsterdam. It is a lot of 160 by 180 meters.
To maintain the nature-like surroundingss south of Amsterdam, the new neighborhood has to be composed of a lot of free space with 
just a few houses; plans of 20, 40 or 60 houses are considerd.

Three different kinds of houses (small, medium and large) are designed to be built on the lot. Each of the houses will be build in a fixed
percentage of the total amout of houses and each of these houses has their own properties regarding dimensions and price. The houses are
obliged to have a fixed minimum amount of free space; each extra meter of free space will result in a rise in the worth of the house.

To preserve the rural design of the neigborhood, 20% of the neigborhood has to consist of water present in 4 rectangular or oblong bodies.
